    history: "The Southern Resident killer whales (also called orcas/Orcinus orca) are a large extended family, or clan, comprised of three pods: J, K, and L pods. Within each pod, families form into sub-pods centered around older females, usually grandmothers or great-grandmothers. Both male and female offspring remain in close association with their mothers for life. From spring through fall, the Southern Resident killer whales are most often seen in the protected inshore waters of the Salish Sea. The Salish Sea includes the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Strait of Georgia, and Puget Sound, and all their connecting channels and adjoining waters, and the waters around and between the San Juan Islands in Washington State and the Gulf Islands in British Columbia."

    location:"Strait of Gibraltar and Gulf of CÃ¡diz",
    history: "Orcas have been described in the Strait of Gibraltar associated with tuna fisheries for at least 2000 years. They are using two strategies to feed on them. One, exhausting the tunas, chasing them during around 30 minutes, which implicates high energetic investment, and another one, interacting with the long line fishery in the central waters of the Strait since the beginning of the 90s."
