    history: "The Southern Resident killer whales are a large extended family, or clan, comprised of three pods: J, K, and L pods. Within each pod, families form into sub-pods centered around older females, usually grandmothers or great-grandmothers. Both male and female offspring remain in close association with their mothers for life. From spring through fall, the Southern Resident killer whales are most often seen in the protected inshore waters of the Salish Sea. The Salish Sea includes the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Strait of Georgia, and Puget Sound, and all their connecting channels and adjoining waters, and the waters around and between the San Juan Islands in Washington State and the Gulf Islands in British Columbia."

    location:"Strait of Gibraltar and Gulf of Cádiz",
    history: "Orcas have been described in the Strait of Gibraltar associated with tuna fisheries for at least 2000 years. They are using two strategies to feed on them. One, exhausting the tunas, chasing them during around 30 minutes, which implicates high energetic investment, and another one, interacting with the long line fishery in the central waters of the Strait since the beginning of the 90s."

    conservation:"Lulu, the ninth member of the group, died after becoming entangled and stranded on Tiree, in the Hebrides, in January 2016. Lulu’s death was tragic but it provided us with a unique insight into the threats facing this small and unique group. Contaminant analysis of tissue taken from Lulu’s necropsy, carried out by the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme, showed that she had one of the highest levels of PCB burden ever recorded in the species - 100 times higher than the accepted threshold for PCB toxicity in marine mammals! High levels of PCBs cause poor health and infertility. Although she was sexually mature, Lulu‘s necropsy showed she had never been pregnant. This finding, linked with the fact that no calves have been recorded in the West Coast Community since monitoring began, suggests that this unique group of killer whales will become extinct in the coming years.",
    location:"Hebrides archipelago, Scotland",
    history: "Numbering only eight individuals (four males and four females), members of the West Coast Community - the only resident UK population - can be distinguished from other groups of  killer whales seen around Scotland by their unusual sloping eye patch and larger size. These animals truly are a west coast community, with sightings recorded from the whole of the western seaboard of the UK and Ireland. Although the group is wide ranging, most sightings have been within the Hebrides. Some individuals have not been seen in recent years and there have been no calves observed since monitoring began in the 1990’s."

    location: "Iceland",
    history: "The Iceland Orca population (resident pods) is believed to be around 5,000 individuals. They can be spotted anywhere in Iceland, but most frequently in the rich herring grounds off the East Fjords, and the South and West coasts of Iceland. In summertime, orcas tend to be close to shore, in inlets and bays, but preferring deeper waters during the winter months."
